# Quo Vademus?

## Analeipsis

  We are coming up on 50 years since the start of computerized morphological tagging of ancient Greek. 
  
  When we *look back*, we see how much of that history has centered on our sacred texts. 
  
  We scholars of the Jewish and Christian scriptures, and early Christian literature more broadly, are arguably among the most textually obsessive people in the world. 
  
  We have been, and we shall continue to be, at the heart of these conversations and related technological advancements.

## Periblepsis

  A lot of academic publishing in early Christianity is focused on traditional modes of print publication, but the academy and the world are changing rapidly. 
  
  If we *look around*, we will see that scholarly publishing is undergoing a massive, rapid transformation into new forms of embodiment and curation within a Linked Open Data digital ecosystem. 
  
  Our most important, impactful, and lasting contributions may not be traditional print publications, but rather our creative participation in the scholarly networks at the heart of major corpus linguistics projects.
  
  The networks spanning Perseus, First1KGreek, Patristic Text Archive, and new teams and initiatives (such as the Scripture Restoration Collective) are growing larger and more connected everyday.

## Autosyneidesis

  Let's listen to our good passions and find ways of channeling our textual obsession to make meaningful contributions to the common good. 
  
  Let's be creative yet careful in machine-assisted modes of knowledge creation and curation, which are crucial for downstream analysis and research tasks.
  
  We are the ones who bridge the gap between good enough and gold (expert-checked) data, whether in terms of optical character recognition, handwritten character recognition, manuscript transitions, editions, translations, and morphosyntactical annotations.

# Introducing AGDTmini & CATnaPS
<br><br>

*Goal*

Let's make Greek morphology searches and morphologically tagged corpora simple, accessible, and phenomenologically citable<br>
